    <div class="content">
      <p>Okay. So you are learning Python.</p>
<p>You know it&rsquo;s good for non-tech people to learn because of its simple syntax and popularity.</p>
<p>You might have found courses on YouTube or other websites, some giving you interactive panels, or some exercises.</p>
<p>But you just don&rsquo;t feel like doing it anymore when it comes to classes or things that doesn&rsquo;t sound daily-life to you.</p>
<p>I get it. And guess what: it&rsquo;s okay not to understand those things in this stage anyway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What stage?&rdquo; you may ask.</p>
<p>You see. I learned the language when I was a senior-high. I didn&rsquo;t understand classes or object-oriented programming or stuff like that. But I did keep going and now I am a master student whose daily life is programming in Python. (Of course I don&rsquo;t program as well as people in CS, but I solve problems in it.)</p>
<p>Looking back, I found myself being through 4 stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stage I: Got the basic</li>
<li>Stage II: Actually used it</li>
<li>Stage III: Learned about refactor and unit testing</li>
<li>Stage IV: Be part of the community (&lt;- I am here)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me explain them one by one:</p>
<h2 id="stage-i-got-the-basic">Stage I: Got the basic <a href="#stage-i-got-the-basic" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>I learned the language as a senior high school student on Codecademy.</p>
<p>The interactive panel, good. The verbose instruction on how to proceed, good. Though the practices appeared mundane, keep in mind that in this stage, repetition is the key.</p>
<p>As I said, things about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) was rather confusing at this stage. But I just did the exercises (which were mainly repititon anyway) and proceeded.</p>
<h2 id="stage-ii-actually-used-it">Stage II: Actually used it <a href="#stage-ii-actually-used-it" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>After Stage I, I tried to use the language whenever I found possible.</p>
<p>Doing the calculation with <code>python3</code> interactive shell on the terminal? Done. Writing functions to display theoratical prediction, done.</p>
<p>But the main part is to process the data collected in lab courses (even though sometimes it&rsquo;d be easier done in Excel).</p>
<p>I became friends with <code>matplotlib</code>, <code>scipy</code> and <code>numpy</code> in this stage. And I believe you will too.</p>
<h2 id="stage-iii-learned-about-refactor-and-unit-testing">Stage III: Learned about refactor and unit testing <a href="#stage-iii-learned-about-refactor-and-unit-testing" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>After writing those scripts for a long period of time, I found the clumsyness of those scripts anonying. Functions that call each other and led to un-debuggable disasters? <code>print(...)</code>s inbetween as log messages? All these burdens led to an inevitable lesson: refactor and unit testing.</p>
<p>I replaced codes by snippets on Stack Overflow, wrote one-liner whenever possible and non-misleading, and I tested functions that would last for a while with unit testing.</p>
<p>I understood OOP at this point, since sometimes you do need to store data into things that can act on other things. (And no that won&rsquo;t make you understand OOP without going through the previous stages.)</p>
<h2 id="stage-iv-be-part-of-the-community">Stage IV: Be part of the community <a href="#stage-iv-be-part-of-the-community" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>Now, I write functions and classes intuitively (though it&rsquo;s never easy). I collect modules and pack them into a package. (I learned Git and GitHub in Stage II&amp;III so it&rsquo;s easy to develop them in a well-organized way.)</p>
<p>I developed a package called <a href="https://github.com/Yuan-Ru-Lin/b2pandas" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>b2pandas</code></a> that helps me deal with the analysis code that I used for my Master research.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t say I am over this Stage until I upload the package on PyPl<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. In such way, one can say he/she is a part of the Python community and be confident on making this whole environment a better place.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary <a href="#summary" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>If you still want to learn Python, here are some points that you may keep in mind when having this journey:</p>
<ol>
<li>It&rsquo;s okay not to understand some concepts &ndash; use them as if you knew it and someday you will.</li>
<li>Use the language whenever you find possible, even if it costs a bit more time.</li>
<li>Learn about refactor and unit testing when you find your codes hard to read.</li>
</ol>

<p>PyPl is like App Store for Python packages, but every package is free and open-source, which means you can contribute and use them almost all you want.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
